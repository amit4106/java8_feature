Batch Updates:
When you multiple queries to database one by one then lot of time will be wasted for request and response
ex-using statement
for one sql statement=request time(5 MS) rt + complie time(5MS) + execution time(5MS) + response time (5 MS)=20MS total time.
for 100 sql statement = 100*20=(2000 MS)
using update statement 
for one sql statement = 5 + 0 + 5 + 5 =15MS
for 100 sql statements = 100*15=1500MS

In the above two cases you are trying to submit 100 sql statements. For submitting 100 sql statements, you need to comunicate database 100
times. This increases number round trips b/w your application and database. Which damage the application performance.

Batch updates allow you to submit multiple sql statements to the database at a time
For 100 sql statements =(5MS+100*5+100*5+5)=1010 MS

Note:
You can use UID (Update/Insert/Delete) query only. 
You cann't use select query.
